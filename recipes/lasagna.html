    <h2>The Secret Behind This Classic Lasagna Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</ul>
    <ul>1 pound ground beef chuck</ul>
    <ul>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</ul>
    <ul>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</ul>
    <ul>2 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
    <ul>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</ul>
    <ul>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</ul>
    <ul>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</ul>
    <ul>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</ul>
    <ul>Salt</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
    <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).</li>
